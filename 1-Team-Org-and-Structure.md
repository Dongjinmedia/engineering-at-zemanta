# Team Organisation and Structure 

At Zemanta we're organised as follows:

## 1. Management Team

This team manages and oversees work and output of the entire company. The CEO is the head of this team and all team members report directly to the CEO.

Team members:

* **CPO** - oversees and manages the customer success team that consists of account managers and product managers
* **CTO** - ultimatively responsible for applying the right technology to the problem(s) at hand of product managers
* **VP Engineering** - manages all engineering teams, responsible for systems operations, engineering hiring manager, main infrastructure architect
* **VP Sales** - sales manager


## 2. Customer Success Team

As the name implies, this team exists so our customers (advertisers / content marketers) can be successful at what they do - promote content by driving audiences to it packaged into campaigns. 

There are multiple roles within this team but here are the 2 main roles:

* **Product Manager** - think "mini CEO" [responsible](http://www.restreaming.me/blog/2014/7/10/product-managers-responsibilities-at-zemanta) for:
   1. Analyze market & competitors
   2. Define product requirements
   3. Write and prioritize user stories
   4. Work with engineers
   5. Authorize feature releases
   6. Shape business processes
   7. Communicate /w stakeholders
   8. Analyze product performance
* **Account Manager & Customer Support** - mainly responsible for managing managed campaigns for our clients and supporting self-serve users of our DSP platform
* **Product Marketing Manager** - this is a US based position and PMMs are responsible for marketing out product, helping sales to grasp our ever envolving technology, managing post release communication to clients 


## 3. Engineering

Engineering is organized into 5 teams, each with it's own role and purpose. Every team has a tech lead to whom all engineers within that team report to and a assigned product manager. Product manager and tech lead share a responsibility for project and program managment. We do not have dedicated project managers for that matter. 

The 5 aforementioned teams are:

* **Next Generation Team** - responsible for building next generation features of our platform that are directly exposed to our users
* **Support and Improve Team** - empowered to make continious improvements to features introduced to our platform and making sure things don't break backwards
* **Backend Team** - we own a large backend responsible for real time bidding, this team builds features that are backend related and supports our supply partners
* **Data Science Team** -
