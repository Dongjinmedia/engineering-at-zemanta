# Engineering at Zemanta

Zemanta keeps process, product development and engineering practices transparent, forkable &amp; documented (hopefully open someday).

The goal of maintaining documentation of *"how we do stuff"* as a repository of markdown files on github is to treat our process:

1. **transparent** - here for everyone to see 
2. **forkable** - everybody on our team is empowered and encouraged to improve and refine our process, so just send a pull request, we'll discuss this ASAP within the team and implement the changes
3. **documented** - helps new hires to "get around" faster, makes everyone aware of what the team expects of them

**Note:** Let's work on the assumption we might just open source this whole repo down the road. Why? Because, why not? People would be able to directly see how we operate and work together *before* they join the company.  

## Where do I start ?

1. **Services** - the purpose of slack, google apps, github, new relic, pingdom ... 
2. **Team Organisation and Structure** - how the team functions and operates from a high level perspective ...
3. **Lifecycle of a Task** - the best way to learn about the process of product development and engineering is to follow the lifecycle of an idea, envolving into a product feature all the way up to code running in production
4. **Code Reviews** - team value: no single line of code should't go into production without an additional set of eyes passing through
5. **Coding Practices** - definitely not a "set in stone" internal 
6. **Testing**
7. **Monitoring**
