# Engineering at Zemanta

Zemanta keeps process, product development and engineering practices transparent, forkable &amp; documented (hopefully open someday).

The goal of maintaining documentation of *"how we do stuff"* as a repository of markdown files on github is to treat our process:

1. **transparent** - here for everyone to see 
2. **forkable** - everybody on our team is empowered and encouraged to improve and refine our process, so just send a pull request, we'll discuss this ASAP within the team and implement the changes
3. **documented** - helps new hires to "get around" faster, makes everyone aware of what the team expects of them

**Note:** Let's work on the assumption we might just open source this whole repo down the road. Why? Because, why not? People would be able to directly see how we operate and work together *before* they join the company.  

## Where do I start ?

1. **Services** 
2. **Team Organisation and Structure**
3. **Lifecycle of a Task**
4. **Code Reviews**
5. **Coding Practices**
6. **Testing**
7. **Monitoring**
