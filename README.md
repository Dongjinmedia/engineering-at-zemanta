# Engineering at Zemanta

Zemanta keeps process, product development and engineering practices transparent, forkable &amp; documented (hopefully open someday).

The goal of maintaining documentation of *"how we do stuff"* as a repository of markdown files on github is to treat our process:

1. **transparent** - here for everyone to see
2. **forkable** - everybody on our team is empowered and encouraged to improve and refine our process, so just send a pull request, we'll discuss this ASAP within the team and implement the changes
3. **documented** - helps new hires to "get around" faster, makes everyone aware of what the team expects of them

## Where do I start ?

1. **[Services](1-Services.md)** - the purpose of slack, google apps, github, new relic ...
2. **[Team Organization and Structure](2-Team-Org-and-Structure.md)** - how the team functions and operates from a high level perspective ...
3. **[Lifecycle of a Task](3-Lifecycle-of-a-Task.md)** - the best way to learn about the process of product development and engineering is to follow the life-cycle of an idea, evolving into a product feature all the way up to code running in production
4. **[Code Reviews](4-Code-Reviews.md)** - team value: no single line of code shouldn't go into production without an additional set of eyes passing through
5. **[Coding Practices](5-Coding-Practices.md)** - by no means a "set in stone" internal guideline, but a non-exaustive collection of good practices collected over time
6. **[Testing](6-Testing.md)** - multiple angles on how to keep your code tested
7. **[Monitoring](7-Monitoring.md)** - making sure we'll be able to monitor your code once on production
8. **[Ecosystem](8-Ecosystem.md)** - explained the ecosystem we use at Zemanta
9. **[Helpful Resources](9-Helpful-Resources.md)** - tutorials to help you learn technologies we use at Zemanata, as effectively as possible

*If you're a new hire, we recommend reading through these documents very diligently. Asking questions and requiring clarifications is entirely appropriate and will enable us to refine the documentation where it lacks details and clarity. Thank you!*
