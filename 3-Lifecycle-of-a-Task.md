# Lifecycle of a Task

We'll follow one task from it's inception as an idea, all the way to it's implementation and the ultimate release to the user.

## 1. From Ideas to Epics

Engineers are usually concerned with the **HOW** should we build something, but when fused together with the rest of the company, especially product managers we're engaged with the question **WHAT** to build.

The anwsers to WHAT's are ideas and as long as they're not put in writing they stay ideas in someones head that will never reach the stage of actuall executuon.

----

**Important general note**

One of key principles at Zemanta that touches almost all aspects of our work is:

***"If it's not in writing it doesn't exist!"***

Examples:

* if you didn't send an email about a release, it wasn't released
* if you didn't write an update on trello as a comment, you weren't working on it
* if you didn't send an invite for that meeting, it didn't took place

----

If an idea is not to just do a small alteration of an existing feature, but to introduce an entirely new concept into our product product managers put their idea into writing in a **product requirements document (PRD).**

## 2. Product Requirements document

A PRD is in writing because it makes a product manager's job easier, since they're able to gather all the input that's coming from many channels (i.e. sales, engineering, client's themselves) and then formulate a feature in writing so all the stakeholders that are even separated by continents and time zones can observe and participate in the process of refining ideas into the final feature.

You'll see that a PRD can contain:

* market research notes
* links to correspondence with clients
* feature rationale
* diagrams, wireframes and whatever it takes to explain the UI to the person who'll be developing this
* ...

## 3. Epic

Once a PRD is synced with stakeholders it will go to a **milestones** trello board, it will be placed in on trello ticket and we call that an **epic**.

The milestones trello board is in place so everybody has a clear overview of the roadmap on a single dashboard.

## 4. Backlog

On a weekly basis, it's both a product manager's (PM) and tech lead's (TL) job to negotiate the priority of execution of epics and once that's determined both the PM and TL will transfer epics onto a **backlog trello board**.

PM & TL will also look into the size of an epic and they might break it down to smaller deliverable tickets on the backlog.

Once tickets end up on the backlog it's also time for engineers to get involved by providing technical feedback back to PM - in writing of course. We call this technical feedback **tech notes**.

The purpose of providing tech notes on the backlog is to provide a brief outline how a feature will be implemented, obtain additional clarification from PM and to anwser common questions a PM might have:

* what's the basic outline of the implementation?
* which systems will the new feature alter?
* will this feature yield major architectural changes?
* what's a ballpark estimate on how long will it take to implement and how many of your team mates will this occupy?
* what are the known unknowns going forward?
* where are the risks of this getting really complicated which would delay the expected deliver?









## 5. M



Do note that every engineering team has their own backlog and their main board, but we have a single milestones board.
