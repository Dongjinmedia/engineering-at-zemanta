# Lifecycle of a Task

We'll follow one task from it's inception as an idea, all the way to it's implementation and the ultimate release to the user.

## 1. From Ideas to Epics

Engineers are usually concerned with the **HOW** should we build something, but when fused together with the rest of the company, especially product managers we're engaged with the question **WHAT** to build.

The anwsers to WHAT's are ideas and as long as they're not put in writing they stay ideas in someones head that will never reach the stage of actuall executuon.

----

**Important general note**

One of key principles at Zemanta that touches almost all aspects of our work is:

***"If it's not in writing it doesn't exist!"***

Examples:

* if you didn't send an email about a release, it wasn't released
* if you didn't write an update on trello as a comment, you weren't working on it
* if you didn't send an invite for that meeting, it didn't took place

----

If an idea is not to just do a small alteration of an existing feature, but to introduce an entirely new concept into our product product managers put their idea into writing in a **product requirements document (PRD).**

## 2. Product Requirements document

A PRD is in writing because it makes a product manager's job easier, since they're able to gather all the input that's coming from many channels (i.e. sales, engineering, client's themselves) and then formulate a feature in writing so all the stakeholders that are even separated by continents and time zones can observe and participate in the process of refining ideas into the final feature.

You'll see that a PRD can contain:

* market research notes
* links to correspondence with clients
* feature rationale
* diagrams, wireframes and whatever it takes to explain the UI to the person who'll be developing this
* ...

## 3. Epic

Once a PRD is synced with stakeholders it will go to a **milestones** trello board, it will be placed in on trello ticket and we call that an **epic**.

The milestones trello board is in place so everybody has a clear overview of the roadmap on a single dashboard.
