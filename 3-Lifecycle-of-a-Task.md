# Lifecycle of a Task

We'll follow one task from it's inception as an idea, all the way to it's implementation and the ultimate release to the user.

## 1. From Ideas to Epics

Engineers are usually concerned with the **HOW** should we build something, but when fused together with the rest of the company, especially product managers we're engaged with the question **WHAT** to build. 

The anwsers to WHAT's are ideas and as long as they're not put in writing they stay ideas in someones head that will never reach the stage of actuall executuon.

**Important general note**

One of key principles at Zemanta that touches almost all aspects of our work is: 

***"If it's not in writing it doesn't exist!"***

Examples:

* if you didn't send an email about a release, it wasn't released
* if you didn't write an update on trello as a comment, you weren't working on it
* if you didn't send an invite for that meeting, it didn't took place
