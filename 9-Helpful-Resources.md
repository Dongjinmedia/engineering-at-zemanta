## 1. Go-lang

Here are two repositories that can facilitate your learning of Go programing language. The repositories contains instructions how to install Go, clone the repository and get the dependencies.

* [Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) - a great resource to start with. You can also start with [Matija's version](https://github.com/matijavizintin/tour-of-go) of the tour. 

* [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) - this is a no BS tutorial of Go. It assumes you already know how to code in other languages and want to learn Go and it's idioms fast. [Matija](https://github.com/matijavizintin/effective-go) followed this guide and produced this collection of examples on github.



## 2. Python
