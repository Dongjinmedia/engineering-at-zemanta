# Ecosystem

The ecosystem around Zemanta and our DSP product is very hard to grasp, if you're new to the advertising industry in general. The topics covered below will help you get a better grasp of the daily glossary used in code, meetings and conversations. 

## Native

Zemanta is building a "native" DSP. Native advertising essentially means - advertising that does not break user's flow. 

Analogy: you buy an automobile magazine for the purpose of looking at great pics of cars. In the context of such a magazine, if you'd encounter an advertisment that would advertise funeral services, that adverisement would break your flow and intention of looking at great car pics. On the contrary, if you'd encounter an advertisment of a great car in an automative magazine and that would not break your flow and intention. 

Similar to the analogy above, banner ads break user's flow of seeking out content on the web. A native ad, does not break your flow and looks like relevant content for you to digest. 


## Supply and Demand

You'll hear these two terms interchanging a lot and you'll also encounter them directly in code. 

* **Supply** - our business partners that supply us as with means to ship ads to websites against payment
* **Demand** - advertisers using our platform, who have money to ship ads to websites
