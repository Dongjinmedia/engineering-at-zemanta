# Team Organization and Structure

At Zemanta we're organized as follows:

## 1. Management Team

This team manages and oversees work and output of the entire company. The CEO is the head of this team and all team members report directly to the CEO.

Team members:

* **CPO** - oversees and manages the customer success team that consists of account managers and product managers
* **CTO** - ultimately responsible for applying the right technology to the problem(s) at hand of product managers
* **VP Engineering** - manages all engineering teams, responsible for systems operations, engineering hiring manager, main infrastructure architect
* **VP Sales** - sales manager


## 2. Customer Success Team

As the name implies, this team exists so our customers (advertisers / content marketers) can be successful at what they do - promote content by driving audiences to it.

There are multiple roles within this team but here are the 2 main roles:

* **Product Manager** - think "mini CEO" [responsible](http://www.restreaming.me/blog/2014/7/10/product-managers-responsibilities-at-zemanta) for:
   1. Analyze market & competitors
   2. Define product requirements
   3. Write and prioritize user stories
   4. Work with engineers
   5. Authorize feature releases
   6. Shape business processes
   7. Communicate /w stakeholders
   8. Analyze product performance
* **Account Manager & Customer Support** - mainly responsible for managing managed campaigns for our clients and supporting self-serve users of our DSP platform


## 3. Engineering

Engineering is organized into 2 teams, each with it's own role and purpose. Every team has a tech lead to whom all engineers within that team report to and an assigned product manager. Product manager and tech lead share a responsibility for project and program management. We do not have dedicated project managers for that matter.

The 2 aforementioned teams are:

* **Nextgen Team** - Owns and builds new features for our user facing dashboard and API. Also makes sure campaign settings are synced reliably to all supply partners.
* **Revenue Team** - In charge of scaling our real-time bidding infrastructure. This also includes supporting our supply partners and improving prediction models.
