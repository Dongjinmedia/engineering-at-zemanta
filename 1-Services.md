# Services

At Zemanta we rely on multiple 3rd party SaaS services to bare different responsibilities. A prerequisite for new hires, to get a grasp on how we operate, is to first obtain access to all of these services.

All services mentioned below are managed by an **IT manager** - not an full time role at the moment, so VP of Engineering is currenlty in charge. 


## 1. Google apps

Everybody get's a `name.lastname@zemanta.com` email account hosted on google apps. IT manager can provide you one. Not only you'll be able to access your email, calendar, google drive, hangouts etc, but it will also serve you as the prefered method of authenticating with other services i.e. trello, slack, etc.

Within google apps, we use the following products besides email of course:

* **calendar** - in there you'll find meetings that you're required to attend to on a weekly basis, it's your manager's role to make sure you're invited to these meetings where appropriate
* **hangouts** - preferred means for video conferences
* **google drive** - we use google drive very extensively and there you'll be able to find: prouct requirements documents, ad hoc spreadsheets, metting logs and notes, even notes from one on one chats


## 2. Slack
